This is a project for the Design Thinking and Communcation Class at Northwestern University. Contributing team members include Augustine Villalobos, Charmaine Guo, Ivan Dolphan, and Milo Fernandez. 

Project Problem
With assistance from our project partner, Emma Martell, the Director of Child, Teen, and Family Engagement at the Lincoln Park Zoo, we developed a telepresence system to provide users at the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago with an interactive virtual tour of the zoo. Previous telepresence efforts, such as a user-controlled robot, were unreliable and did not effectively engage patients, thus highlighting the need for a new solution.

Project Requirements
The purpose of this project was to design a more engaging, reliable, and user-friendly telepresence experience that allows users to explore zoo exhibits remotely. The solution had to be easy for zoo staff to operate while providing an immersive experience for end users.

Research and Development
We spoke with Emma Martell to gather the zoo’s history with telepresence challenges and observed both zoo exhibits and the original telepresence robot. We also looked into the needs of users in engagement and assessed current telepresence systems. Using this information, we created and tested some prototypes before finalizing a functional design.

Design Summary
Our final design, Skynet, is a zip-line camera system controlled remotely via a web application. It features:
- A lightweight zip-line-mounted camera vehicle that moves smoothly across exhibits, providing a live video feed.
- Secure and adjustable mounting mechanisms for easy installation and stability.
- A user-friendly web interface allowing patients to control the camera’s movement and interact with zoo educators.

Skynet improves upon past attempts at providing a telepresence solution by being portable, easy to install, and highly interactive. All of this promises a more engaging experience for users. Future improvements could potentially include an adjustable camera mount for better viewing angles and additional interactive features to enhance the engagement of users.
